    "# About this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the first part of a larger collection of notebooks that try to solve the Kaggle Competition - Spaceship Titanic. The goal of this competition is to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The competition can be found in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/spaceship-titanic/overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection of notebooks is structured as follows:\n",
    "- Notebook 1: Problem Exploration\n",
    "- Notebook 2: Data Wrangling + Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "- Notebook 3: Model Selection and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular this notebook provides, after understanding the data, a process of cleaning and transforming data will be applied to the datasets. Also, new features will be generated in the feature engineering stage.  In summary, this section covers the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data transformation: Dealing with missing values, transforming columns to other types…etc\n",
    "- Feature Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, let's get started! 🤘\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# Project summary\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we could summarize the project as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total number of passengers: 13K passengers (14 columns)\n",
    "- **Goal**: To predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly\n",
    "- **Target column**: Transported (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\n",
    "- Evaluation: Accuracy (percentage of passengers correctly predicted)\n",
    "- Type of problem: Binary Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to take into account that although I will approach this problem as a binary classification I will try use different models (logistic regression, random forest, neural networks, etc.) and different feature engineering techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to learn and practice different techniques and to compare the results obtained with each of them."

    "One effective approach to address missing values is to combine the train and test datasets into a single dataset while excluding the target variable from the training data. This consolidation allows for a more organized and systematic analysis of missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon inspecting the dataset, it becomes evident that missing values account for approximately 2% of the data, which represents a relatively modest proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle missing data, a straightforward method involves using the median for continuous features and the mode for categorical features. Although this approach can produce acceptable results, achieving optimal model accuracy requires a more nuanced strategy that includes a thorough examination of missing data patterns."

    "\n",
    "One common technique for handling missing data using joint distributions is the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The EM algorithm estimates missing values by iteratively maximizing the likelihood function of the observed and missing data jointly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It assumes a joint distribution for the complete data and iteratively refines its estimates of missing values until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of missing data, a joint distribution is often used to model the relationships between variables that are observed (non-missing) and those that are missing. It allows statisticians and data scientists to represent the joint probability distribution of both observed and missing data, which can be valuable for various tasks, such as imputing missing values or understanding the dependencies between variables.\n",
